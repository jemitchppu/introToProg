// NOTE: You can enter both code and explanations. For an explanation, start
//       the line with '//' which indicates a comment.

// NOTE: console.log prints text to the browser console that you can enable
//       to see the output. It is a little bit more convenient than alert so
//       we will use it most of the time.



//-----------//
// Variables //
//-----------//
console.log("Variables");

// 1. Create a string variable called 'name' and store your name in it.
var name = "Joe Mitchell";
// 2. Write code to alert your name in the browser.
alert(name);
// 3. Create two number variables name 'first' and 'second'. Assign 13 to
//    first and 26 to second. Alert the sum of the two variables in the browser.
var first = 13;
var second = 26;


//--------//
// Values //
//--------//
console.log("Values");

// 1. Define a variable 'string_variable' and a variable 'number_variable'.
//    Assign "10" to the string variable and 99 to the number variable.
//    Alert the value of string_variable plus number_variable (use the +
//    operator). Can you explain what happened?
var string_variable = 10;
var number_variable = 99;
alert(string_variable + number_variable);

// for the alert we created a expression to add the 2 different variables together so that they could come out with a new variable with the calculation


//-------------//
// Expressions //
//-------------//
console.log("Expressions");

// 1. Explain what the result of 13 % 5 will be.

// the result of 13 % 5 would export the number 3 as that is the remainder of 13/5. the answer would be 2 3/5 in standard math, but since we asked for the reamainder the output would be 3

// 2. What will be printed to the console after executing the following 3
//    lines? Why?
var num = 3;
console.log(num++);
console.log(++num);

// the number 5 will be printed as we take the number assigned to the variable "num" of 3, then using the ++ expression we add 1 and output that sum equaling 4, but since we also have another line of ++num it adds another to equal 5. The ++ makes no difference if in front of or behind the variable for the expression.

// 3. Remove the ambiguity from the following line but keep the result
//    exactly the same.
console.log(2 * 3 + 3 - 4 / 3);

var numMid = 3;
var numLow = 2;
var numHigh = 4;
console.log(numLow * numMid + numMid - numHigh / numMid);
